# SlimSocial for Facebook 


SlimSocial for Facebook is a lightweight and customizable alternative to the official Facebook app. It was originally [created in 2015](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-slimfacebook-1mb-0-permissions-t3254174) as a project to explore Android app development, but it was put on hold due to university and work commitments.

Recently, I updated the app with a new codebase using Flutter, making it more efficient and user-friendly than ever before. SlimSocial still retains its original values of lightweight design and privacy, while introducing new features, such as the ability to hide ads and a better user interface.

## Features

- Lightweight design: SlimSocial for Facebook is designed to be fast and responsive, even on older devices.

- Customizable: SlimSocial for Facebook allows you to change the app's colors and fonts, giving you the power to make the app look and feel just the way you want it to. You can run custom CSS and JS directly from the app.

- Privacy: SlimSocial for Facebook is built with privacy in mind, allowing you to use Facebook without worrying about your data being collected or shared.

- Hide ads: SlimSocial for Facebook now allows you to hide ads, giving you a more streamlined experience.
